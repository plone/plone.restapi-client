This package is an agnostic client written in TypeScript and built on the top of [@tanstack/query](https://tanstack.com/query) to query Plone 6 backend.

It should be possible to use it in React/Vue/Solid/Svelte projects.

## File Structure

The file structure should match the one in `plone.restapi` package, so it should be organized in folders one for each endpoint family, and following the convention naming depending on the action (add, get, update, delete).

## Documentation

The documentation should match the one in `plone.restapi` package, so it's organized in endpoint services.
